#How to test it on a iPhone#

You can find you local ip address. And assign this address to a domain own by yourself, say:

    gree.diamondtin.com -> 10.64.20.109

This will allow you access your local server from iphone without a public ip. Since gogole don't allow callback on ip address, it only allows domain name. If you can manage your local DNS records it will also works.
